      <h1>Amazing Article about Pookie</h1>
      <small>by Fabien Berdah</small>
      <p>Pookie the cutest and smartest and nicest dog in the world. She is so cute that everyone fights for her
        attention. She likes to sleep (a lot), eat, play (sometimes), play with Kelly (the Pookie thief) and simply
        watch TV. She only sleeps with Kelly, and she only likes Kelly. Sometimes, I take as little space as I can and
        leave her almost all the couch so that she can sleep comfortably. I even try not to laught or breathe too deeply
        in order not to disturb her, but as soon as Kelly comes in, it's like I don't exist...
        <br>
        <br>
        She is a real bitch, but she is the cutest bitch in the world and I love her more than Kelly because Kelly is
        also a bitch :).

      <h3>This is Pookie</h3>
      <img src="./img/Pookie.jpg" alt="Picture of my dog Pookie">
      <p>Pookie was born on December 8th 2010 and she won our hearts right away. She smelled really bad but she was so
        cute
        and tiny that we couldn't resist. She was so shy at first, but as soon as she got confident, she got really
        confident!!! She started jumping around everywhere, all the time, up, down, up, down, higher, lower, on the
        couch,
        on the back of the couch, and back down... Jumping from a height of 5 times her height!!!
        <br><br>
        Also, when we play ball with her, we have to go an pick the ball ourselves, because she is too lazy to bring it
        back. Sometimes, she just goes to get the ball and she runs away with it so that we don't throw it again.

        She is a coward, always hidding in the face of danger, but she has the best personality and she is so funny. She
        is the kindest dog in the world and our best friend in the Universe. There is no one like Pookie and she knows
        this, but she loves us too and always comes to comfort us when we are stressed.
        <br><br>
        We love you Pookie!
